# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Next.js application that aims to leverage the power of `shadcn/ui` for its user interface. The goal is to build a modern, accessible, and feature-rich application by following the best practices for AI, forms, and real-time features as outlined in the project's markdown prompts.

## Current State

### Style & Design

*   **UI Framework**: `shadcn/ui`
*   **Style**: "new-york"
*   **Base Color**: "slate"
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables.
*   **React Server Components (RSC)**: Currently disabled.

### Registries

*   A custom registry with the namespace `@tactms` is configured.

### Features

*   The project has a basic structure with `app`, `components`, and `lib` directories.
*   The specific features are yet to be fully explored.

## Plan

My plan is to iteratively improve the application by:

1.  **Fixing flaws and bugs**: I will identify and fix any existing issues in the codebase.
2.  **Integrating `shadcn/ui` components**: I will leverage the `shadcn mcp tools` to integrate `shadcn/ui` components and blocks, following the project's design guidelines.
3.  **Implementing features**: I will implement the features described in the `NextJs-AI-Prompt.md`, `NextJs-Forms-Prompt.md`, and `NextJs-Realtime-Prompt.md` files.
4.  **Enabling RSC**: I will investigate the possibility of enabling React Server Components to improve performance and align with Next.js best practices.
5.  **Maintaining this blueprint**: I will keep this document updated with the latest changes and the current state of the project.
